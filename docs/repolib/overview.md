## Usage

There are two main ways to use REPOLib:

- [**Via the C# API.**](./api/start.md) The most flexible, but requires coding.
- [**Via the Unity Editor.**](./sdk/start.md) Does not require coding, but is less flexible.

Which method to choose depends on your experience level and project scope. For new modders and smaller projects, the Unity workflow is recommended.
